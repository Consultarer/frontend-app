# Getting Started

## Initial troubleshooting

1. No Babel config file detected
   1.1. Open file named `.eslintrc.js` in the root of your project
   1.2. Set the following code to the file:

```javascript
module.exports = {
  root: '',
  extends: '@react-native',
};
```

2. File is a CommonJS module
   1. Rename the problematic files from `*.js` to `*.cjs`, except `metro.config.js`

- Reference https://stackoverflow.com/questions/49582984/how-do-i-disable-js-file-is-a-commonjs-module-it-may-be-converted-to-an-es6

3. Unable
   1. Create a new file in your project's root directory with the name react-native-metro-config.d.ts.
   2. Add the following content to the newly created file:

```typescript
declare module '@react-native/metro-config';
```

- Reference: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/64994997/react-native-typescript-unable-to-resolve-module-react-native-metro-config

4. Rename `index.js` to `index.ts`
5. Move `App.tsx` to `src` folder

> **Note**: Make sure you have completed the [React Native - Environment Setup](https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup) instructions till "Creating a new application" step, before proceeding.

## Step 1: Start the Metro Server

First, you will need to start **Metro**, the JavaScript _bundler_ that ships _with_ React Native.

To start Metro, run the following command from the _root_ of your React Native project:

```bash
# using npm
npm start

# OR using Yarn
yarn start
```

## Step 2: Start your Application

Let Metro Bundler run in its _own_ terminal. Open a _new_ terminal from the _root_ of your React Native project. Run the following command to start your _Android_ or _iOS_ app:

### For Android

```bash
# using npm
npm run android

# OR using Yarn
yarn android
```

### For iOS

```bash
# using npm
npm run ios

# OR using Yarn
yarn ios
```

If everything is set up _correctly_, you should see your new app running in your _Android Emulator_ or _iOS Simulator_ shortly provided you have set up your emulator/simulator correctly.

This is one way to run your app — you can also run it directly from within Android Studio and Xcode respectively.

## Step 3: Modifying your App

Now that you have successfully run the app, let's modify it.

1. Open `App.tsx` in your text editor of choice and edit some lines.
2. For **Android**: Press the <kbd>R</kbd> key twice or select **"Reload"** from the **Developer Menu** (<kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>M</kbd> (on Window and Linux) or <kbd>Cmd ⌘</kbd> + <kbd>M</kbd> (on macOS)) to see your changes!

   For **iOS**: Hit <kbd>Cmd ⌘</kbd> + <kbd>R</kbd> in your iOS Simulator to reload the app and see your changes!

## Congratulations! :tada:

You've successfully run and modified your React Native App. :partying_face:
